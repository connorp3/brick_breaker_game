### Breakout Variant

We thought the variant of Breakout that included pinball-style elements in the scene with the bricks was interesting.
These elements could be added as their own class with interesting attributes that make the game more interesting. This
variation was also collaborative, and multiple players worked together to break bricks from either side of the window.

### General Level Descriptions

Level 1: Easy

This level will just be the most basic model of Breakout to introduce the user to the game. It will be a grid of 
bricks (all of the same type). There will be a gap between the back wall and the bricks to incentivize the user
to break through a full column of bricks to reach the back wall and get the ball stuck so that it breaks a large 
amount of bricks.

Level 2: Brick Pyramid

This level will be a grid of bricks that taper into a pyramid in the last few layers of bricks that get closer
 to the user paddle. Within the grid of bricks, some will take multiple collisions to break.
 
Level 3: Brick Diamond

This level will be a diamond of bricks, where the bricks require progressively more hits to break as you get closer
to the center of the diamond.

Level 4: Moving Bricks Arena

This level will be a rectangle of non-moving bricks, and within this square will be laterally moving bricks.

Sketches of each level are provided here in the link below. Number and size of bricks in the sketches may not be
exactly what is designed in the program. These sketches are just for general configuration visualization.

### Bricks Ideas



### Power Up Ideas

Wider Paddle: When this power-up collides with the user paddle, the user paddle increases in size (1.5x?)

Slower Ball: When this power-up collides with the user paddle, the ball decreases in speed (0.75x?)

### Cheat Key Ideas

### Something Extra

Our idea for a substantial addition is to make two-player (multi-paddle) Breakout. In this version, there would be
two paddles (and two balls?) on either end of the window, and they would be controlled by different keys (ASDW and
arrow keys). We think this is a substantial addition to the game because it introduces a collaborative element to
the game and changes game-play strategy.
