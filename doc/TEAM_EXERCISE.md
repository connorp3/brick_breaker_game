## Round 1

 * How did it feel to be in a team when one person is more capable than the other?
 
 We felt like we needed to do better when we were less capable. On a bigger scale, one can see how this
 would translate to a feeling of hopelessness or feeling lost in the project. The person who was less 
 capable was worried about being left behind.


## Round 2

Notice if you feel resentful, frustrated, proud, confident, etc.

 * How did it feel when you are having an easier time than your partner with the task?
 
 It felt good to be done with the portion assigned to you, but you felt the urge to assist the other
 person so that all tasks would be completed.

 * How did it feel when you are having a harder time than your partner?
 
 It felt like the person having a harder time was being rushed and was under a lot of pressure to not
 let down the other partner.


## Round 3

 * Did you ask for help when you need it? Did you offer?
 
 We didn't find ourselves finishing at vastly different times, but we like to think that we would've
 asked for help or offered if necessary.

 * How do you offer help without offending? How do you ask for help without guilt?
 
 Focusing the offer or request of help around the need to meet a deadline rather than the lack of capability
 or work done by the person helps to create a sense of unity in helping.

 * What would it feel like if one partner took over and did the entire task, leaving you out?
 
 It would be a little relieving at first, but it would make the left out person feel incapable and not trusted
 to do the task at hand. It would also be frustrating not being able to have a say in the project.


## Round 4

 * How did you and your partner get better with the task over time?
 
 We discussed better sorting strategies in between rounds. We found the best colors to sort first and the
 best method to move the candies around on the small surface.
